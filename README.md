# IRIS-Dataset-Visualization
This project is an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the classic Iris Flower dataset using Python. The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and data science for testing algorithms. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target class (species).
